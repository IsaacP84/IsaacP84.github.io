A ball travels back and forth between one side to the other.
The player(s) can move a paddle up and down.
If the ball hits the paddle, it bounces off and reflects.
If the ball passes a player's paddle, the other player gains a point.
    After, the ball is reset.

Will need variable for the ball's position and speed.
Will need variable for the paddles' y positions.
Will need a score variable.

The game doesn't need an end, but the game could end when a players score reaches a certain value.

Ifs:
    If the ball is touching the paddle
    If the ball is past the paddle
    If the score is greater than an amount
    If the paddles are further than an amount

Visual Game Concepts:
    Components:
        The paddles
            -Animated
            Points
            PosY
            SpeedY
            Constant PosX
            width/height
        The ball
            -Animated
            PosX, PosY
            SpeedX, SpeedY
            (?) Speed, Angle instead off Speed, SpeedY
            radius or width/height
        The board
            -Static
            width/height

Logic:
    Maybe a click to start
    A timer for when the ball resets
    Up/down arrow keys
        changes the paddle position for player 2
    W/A keys
        changes the paddle position for player 1
